CC: feeling anxious, short of breath, syncope

HPI
54 year old female patient with a history of asthma presents in to the ED for dyspnea. Patient states that she was at her physical therapist and began to feel short of breath so after her appointment she was going to her allergy immunologist. On the way there her e bike battery died and she had to walk the rest of the way. When she got there she felt very lightheaded and short of breath and then passed out. Transported here by EMS without intervention. Normal o2 on room air throughout.

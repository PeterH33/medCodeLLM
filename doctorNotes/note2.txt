Differential diagnosis includes and cranial hemorrhage, contusion, fracture.

Un reassessment patient remains hemodynamically stable and with non-focal neurologic exam. Plane films of the right hip and the left leg are negative for acute fracture, CT scan of the cervical spine, and the lumbar spine are negative for acute fracture or other acute traumatic injury. CT of the head shows a questionable asymmetric thickening of the inferior falx.

Called to discuss with on-call neurosurgeon, in agreement with admission to our facility, repeat had CT at six hours. Patient and family are updated on all results and comfort a plan of care. Called and discussed with hospitalist for admission.

I personally viewed an interpreted patient’s EKG, chest, x-ray, plain films, CT imaging, laboratory results.

Disposition – admit for further observation and repeat head CT

Research Note: 
EXPERIMENT ABORTED INFINITE LOOP
Once again, meditron has gotten stuck in an infinite loop. This time while attempting to make up elaborate json that was not requested. 
Due to repeated infinite loop locks and general poor performance the meditron model is being dropped from consideration. Unfortunate that both models do not appear suitable for the task.
It is possible that there is some setting or use method that would make these models function properly.

Replacing meditron with phi4:14b for future tests

Okay, I need to process this doctors note into a specific JSON structure. Let me start by reading through the note carefully. The chief complaint is about jaw clenching and concern for a seizure. 

Looking at the HPI, the patient is a 77-year-old female with a history of stroke and prior seizures. She presented after feeling her jaw clamp this morning. She thinks it might have been a seizure but it was different from her past ones. She's never had jaw spasms before. Her dysarthria and aphasia are still at baseline, and she's been taking Keppra without issues. No recent infections or fever. Her husband mentions similar symptoms in the past with no diagnosis.

In the physical exam, she's alert and not in distress. Pupils reactive, muscles intact. Speech has mild dysarthria and aphasia as baseline. Strength and sensation normal. Face symmetric, oropharynx clear. Normal vital signs.

Hospital history includes seizure and stroke. 

The differential diagnosis includes muscle spasm, dehydration, infection, electrolyte issues, and cranial hemorrhage but low suspicion for focal seizures.

Labs, EKG, CT, and component tests are reassuring with no signs of infection. She was offered further observation but chose to go home as she was comfortable. Disposition is home with return precautions.

The diagnosis given is facial spasm.

So, putting this into the JSON structure: original_document will have the full note verbatim. The diagnostic_code array needs any applicable codes. Since facial spasm isn't a standard code, maybe  R25.1 or another relevant code if available. Diagnosis should list the main issue as facial spasm.
